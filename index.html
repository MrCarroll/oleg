            <h1 id="title">Oleg, a WebRTC demo for video synchronisation without a signalling server </h1>
            <p>
                Oleg is a basic <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> demo demonstrating synchronisation of HTML5 video elements.
                It demonstrates establishing a WebRTC connection without the use of a signalling server.
                It was primarily made to emulate the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=143148073">Cinema</a> gamemode available in Garrys Mod for personal use between me and a friend.
                A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT">TURN server</a> is not provided, so connection establishment may not be possible in several network configurations.
                Particularly, there may be cases where a connection may only be established if one user acts as the host, depending on the results of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment">ICE protocol</a>.
                In rare situations, refreshing both peers simply refreshing the page and attempting a new connection may fix connection difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peers must generate a session description profile using the UI below, and share them with an out of bounds medium.
                For example, Steam, Facebook messenger, email, etc; any service that supports sending text is suitable, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"IP over Avian Carrier</a></a>.
                The initiating client, the host, sends an offer to the guest client. The guest acknowledges the hosts offer and generates a response, the answer.
                When the host accepts the guests answer, the clients will attempt to establish a connection with directly in peer to peer topology.
                Due to different browser defaults, users may need to be fairly rapid in exchanging SDP data to establish a connection. Mozilla Firefox gives a leeway of about 5 seconds,
                which is usable for exchange over IM applications with a little practise. Other browsers may allow for longer or shorter durations.

            </p>
            <p>
                Once in the main Oleg interface, the queue overlay may be triggered and hidden by pressing Q on the keyboard. 
                Users may need to click "Play next" to actually begin taking items off of the queue.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this is a demo project, it is lacking many advanced features users may desire.
                It is highly recommended users are making use of IM or audio calls via a third party tool, so that they can determine if the session is reliable and react accordingly.
                Ultimately, this tool is not intended to be a professional replacement for similar services, it is good enough for my own use and hopefully may benefit or educate others.

                This project makes use of the <a href="http://stunprotocol.org">Stuntman</a> projects publically available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN">STUN</a> instance,
                as well as <a href="https://invidio.us">Invidious</a>, a publically available alternative YouTube frontend and API, hosted on <a href="https://snopyta.org/">Snopyta</a>. Users may benefit from using the WebRTC projects <a href="https://test.webrtc.org/">troubleshooter.</a>
